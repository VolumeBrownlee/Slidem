# Research Presentation Visual Best Practices Guide

## Evidence-Based Design Principles

### Core Cognitive Psychology Principles

**1. Redundancy Principle**
- People learn better from graphics and narration than from graphics, narration, and printed text
- Avoid duplicating spoken content with on-screen text
- Use either images OR text, not both simultaneously (labels are acceptable)

**2. Temporal Contiguity Principle**
- Present corresponding words and pictures simultaneously
- Make objects appear only when mentioned in your narration
- Build slides progressively rather than showing all content at once

**3. Signaling Principle**
- Add visual cues to highlight essential material organization
- Use arrows, circles, or pointers to draw attention to important details
- Guide learners' attention to reduce cognitive overload

### Text and Typography Guidelines

**Font Selection:**
- Use sans serif fonts for better readability
- Choose large font sizes (minimum 30pt for presentations)
- Avoid italics, underlining, and all capital letters
- Use bold instead of underlining for emphasis
- Limit to 2-3 fonts maximum (header, body, accent)

**Text Amount:**
- Follow the "Rule of Four": Maximum 4 bullets per slide
- Each bullet should contain maximum 4 concepts
- Count verbs and nouns to measure information units
- Example: "Use four bullets per slide" = 3 units (use, bullets, slide)
- Aim for 300-800 words total for poster presentations

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Make reading order obvious through font size, color, and weight
- Largest/boldest elements should be most important
- Create clear information flow from primary to secondary content

### Image and Visual Guidelines

**Image Usage:**
- Use high-resolution, royalty-free images
- Never enlarge images beyond 100% of original size
- Favor images over text when possible (images are more memorable)
- Use representational, organizational, or explanative images only
- Avoid decorative images that don't support learning objectives

**Data Visualization:**
- Present data using charts and diagrams instead of text lists
- Select only data most relevant to your points
- Make complex data visually compelling and digestible
- Use visual representations for statistics whenever possible

### Color and Design Principles

**Color Guidelines:**
- Use color combinations accessible to those with visual impairments
- Limit to 2-3 colors total (main colors plus accent)
- Ensure high contrast between text and background
- Test color combinations for accessibility
- Use color purposefully to support content, not decoration

**Spatial Design:**
- Use grid systems for consistent alignment
- Group similar elements along vertical and horizontal lines
- Maintain consistent spacing between elements
- Leave adequate white space for visual breathing room
- Align similar items (headings, descriptions, images, icons)

### Animation and Transitions

**Animation Principles:**
- Use animations only when absolutely necessary
- Make objects appear when mentioned, dim when discussed
- Avoid presentation-wide animations (flying titles, building text)
- Use subtle effects like fade-ins rather than dramatic animations
- Maintain consistency in animation style throughout

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Build content one element at a time
- Dim previous content to 25% opacity when moving to new points
- Guide attention to current discussion topic
- Reduce cognitive load by controlling information flow

### Academic Poster Specific Guidelines

**Size and Layout:**
- Standard size: 4' wide x 3' high (landscape orientation)
- Information should be readable from 10 feet away
- Use meaningful mixture of text, tables, graphs, and pictures
- Organize content for logical flow and easy scanning

**Content Organization:**
- Include clear sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions
- Use consistent formatting throughout sections
- Balance text and visual elements
- Make key findings immediately apparent

### Research-Specific Considerations

**Scientific Accuracy:**
- Ensure all visual representations accurately reflect data
- Use appropriate chart types for data being presented
- Include proper citations and attributions
- Maintain scientific rigor in visual simplification

**Accessibility:**
- Add alt text to all images in distributed presentations
- Use color combinations that work for colorblind viewers
- Ensure font sizes are large enough for visual impairments
- Provide alternative formats when necessary

### Technical Presentation Guidelines

**Equipment Preparation:**
- Test equipment before presentation
- Bring backup files (flash drive, printouts)
- Know your presentation setup requirements
- Plan for potential technical difficulties

**Delivery Integration:**
- Design slides as part of larger performance (pictures, text, spoken words)
- Remember slides support your narrative, don't replace it
- Practice with slides to ensure smooth integration
- Use presenter notes rather than reading from slides

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Visual Overload:**
- Too much text on single slides
- Multiple competing visual elements
- Overuse of animations and transitions
- Cluttered layouts without clear hierarchy

**Accessibility Issues:**
- Poor color contrast
- Font sizes too small
- Missing alt text for images
- Inaccessible color-only information coding

**Content Problems:**
- Decorative images that distract from learning
- Redundant text that duplicates narration
- Information not directly supporting learning objectives
- Poor organization of complex information

### Quality Assurance Checklist

**Before Finalizing:**
- [ ] All fonts are sans serif and minimum 30pt
- [ ] Maximum 4 bullets per slide with 4 concepts each
- [ ] High contrast between text and background
- [ ] Images are high-resolution and support content
- [ ] Consistent color scheme (2-3 colors maximum)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure animations in place
- [ ] Alt text added to all images
- [ ] Content readable from appropriate distance
- [ ] Backup files prepared
- [ ] Presentation tested on target equipment

**Design Philosophy:**
Remember that effective research presentations should facilitate learning and knowledge transfer, not impress with visual effects. Every design choice should serve the goal of clear communication and audience understanding.
