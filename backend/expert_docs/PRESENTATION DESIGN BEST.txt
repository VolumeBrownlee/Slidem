### FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

#### VISUAL HIERARCHY
1. **Primary Elements**: Main headlines, key statistics, call-to-action buttons
2. **Secondary Elements**: Subheadings, supporting data, navigation elements
3. **Tertiary Elements**: Fine print, sources, supplementary information

**Implementation Techniques:**
- Size variation (larger = more important)
- Color contrast (bright colors draw attention)
- Position (top-left gets viewed first in Western cultures)
- Typography weight (bold = emphasis)

#### COLOR PSYCHOLOGY AND APPLICATION
**Warm Colors (Red, Orange, Yellow):**
- Create energy, urgency, and excitement
- Use for call-to-action elements
- Ideal for sales presentations and motivational content

**Cool Colors (Blue, Green, Purple):**
- Convey trust, professionalism, and calm
- Perfect for corporate presentations
- Suitable for data-heavy content

**Neutral Colors (Gray, Black, White):**
- Provide balance and sophistication
- Excellent for backgrounds and supporting elements
- Create professional, timeless appearance

**Color Harmony Rules:**
- Monochromatic: Variations of single color
- Complementary: Opposite colors on color wheel
- Triadic: Three evenly spaced colors
- Analogous: Adjacent colors on color wheel

#### TYPOGRAPHY BEST PRACTICES
**Font Selection Criteria:**
- Readability from distance (minimum 24pt for body text)
- Brand alignment and personality match
- Cultural appropriateness and accessibility
- Device compatibility and web-safe options

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- H1: Main titles (36-48pt)
- H2: Section headers (24-32pt)
- H3: Subsections (18-24pt)
- Body: Main content (16-20pt)
- Caption: Sources, fine print (10-14pt)

#### LAYOUT AND COMPOSITION
**Rule of Thirds:**
- Divide slide into 9 equal sections
- Place important elements at intersection points
- Creates natural visual balance and interest

**Alignment Principles:**
- Left-aligned text for easy reading
- Center alignment for titles and emphasis
- Right alignment for numerical data
- Consistent alignment throughout presentation

**White Space Management:**
- Minimum 10% white space per slide
- Strategic use of white space to separate concepts
- Breathing room around important elements
- Balance between content and empty space

### VISUAL ELEMENTS AND GRAPHICS

#### IMAGERY GUIDELINES
**Photo Selection:**
- High resolution (minimum 300 DPI for print, 72 DPI for screen)
- Authentic, diverse representation

- Purposeful, not decorative
- Proper licensing and attribution

**Icon Usage:**
- Consistent style throughout presentation
- Meaningful and universally understood
- Appropriate size and placement
- Color coordination with overall design
- Accessibility considerations for color-blind users

#### DATA VISUALIZATION
**Chart Selection:**

- Line graphs: Showing trends over time
- Pie charts: Parts of a whole (use sparingly)
- Scatter plots: Correlation relationships
- Infographics: Complex data storytelling

**Design Principles:**
- Clear, descriptive titles and labels
