# General Presentation Design Best Practices Guide

## Universal Design Principles

### Foundation Design Rules

**The Golden Rule of Simplicity:**
- Less is more in presentation design
- One main idea per slide
- Minimal text with maximum visual impact
- Clean, uncluttered layouts

**Rule of Three:**
- Maximum 3 fonts (header, body, accent)
- Maximum 3 colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- Maximum 3 main points per slide
- 3-second rule: audience should understand slide in 3 seconds

**Visual Hierarchy Principles:**
- Size: Larger elements draw attention first
- Color: Bright and contrasting colors stand out
- Position: Upper left gets noticed first (Western readers)
- Contrast: High contrast elements command attention

### Typography Best Practices

**Font Selection Guidelines:**
- **Sans Serif for Digital:** Arial, Helvetica, Calibri, Open Sans
- **Serif for Print:** Times New Roman, Georgia, Minion Pro
- **Script/Decorative:** Use sparingly for emphasis only

**Font Size Standards:**
- **Headlines:** 36-44 points minimum
- **Subheadings:** 24-32 points
- **Body Text:** 18-24 points minimum
- **Captions:** 14-16 points minimum

**Typography Best Practices:**
- Use consistent font weights throughout
- Maintain adequate line spacing (1.2-1.5x font size)
- Avoid underlining (use bold for emphasis)
- Never use more than 2-3 font sizes per slide
- Keep text left-aligned for readability

### Color Theory and Application

**Color Harmony Principles:**
- **Complementary:** Colors opposite on color wheel (blue/orange)
- **Analogous:** Adjacent colors on wheel (blue/blue-green)
- **Triadic:** Three evenly spaced colors on wheel
- **Monochromatic:** Different shades of same color

**Psychological Color Associations:**
- **Red:** Energy, urgency, passion, danger
- **Blue:** Trust, stability, calm, professional
- **Green:** Growth, nature, money, harmony
- **Yellow:** Happiness, creativity, attention, warning
- **Purple:** Luxury, creativity, mystery, spirituality
- **Orange:** Enthusiasm, warmth, affordable, friendly
- **Black:** Sophistication, power, elegance, mystery
- **White:** Purity, simplicity, cleanliness, space

**Color Accessibility:**
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Ensure 3:1 contrast ratio for large text
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Test designs with colorblind simulation tools
- Use patterns or symbols in addition to color coding

### Layout and Composition

**Grid Systems:**
- Use invisible grids to align elements
- Create consistent margins and gutters
- Follow rule of thirds for focal points
- Maintain consistent spacing between elements

**White Space (Negative Space):**
- Allow content to breathe with adequate spacing
- Use white space to group related elements
- Create visual hierarchy through spacing
- Don't feel obligated to fill every space

**Visual Balance:**
- **Symmetrical:** Formal, stable, traditional
- **Asymmetrical:** Dynamic, modern, interesting
- **Radial:** Elements arranged around central point
- **Crystallographic:** Even distribution across space

### Image and Visual Guidelines

**Image Quality Standards:**
- Use high-resolution images (300 DPI for print, 72 DPI for screen)
- Maintain aspect ratios to avoid distortion
- Use consistent image styles throughout presentation
- Ensure images support and enhance content

**Image Types and Usage:**
- **Photographs:** Realistic, emotional connection
- **Illustrations:** Simplified, conceptual representation
- **Icons:** Quick recognition, universal symbols
- **Graphics:** Data visualization, process flows

**Visual Content Rules:**
- Every visual should have a purpose
- Avoid decorative images that don't add value
- Use high-quality, professional imagery
- Maintain consistent visual style and treatment

### Data Visualization Principles

**Chart Type Selection:**
- **Bar Charts:** Comparing quantities across categories
- **Line Charts:** Showing trends over time
- **Pie Charts:** Parts of whole (max 5-7 segments)
- **Scatter Plots:** Correlation between two variables
- **Area Charts:** Cumulative data over time
- **Heat Maps:** Data intensity across two dimensions

**Data Design Best Practices:**
- Start y-axis at zero to avoid misleading
- Use consistent scales across related charts
- Limit data series to avoid confusion
- Use color strategically to highlight key data
- Include clear legends and labels
- Cite data sources appropriately

### Animation and Transitions

**Effective Animation Principles:**
- Use animation to enhance understanding, not impress
- Keep animations simple and purposeful
- Maintain consistency in animation style
- Time animations appropriately with speech
- Test animations on target equipment

**Animation Types:**
- **Entrance:** Fade in, fly in, appear
- **Emphasis:** Grow/shrink, color change, bold
- **Exit:** Fade out, fly out, disappear
- **Motion Paths:** Custom movement across slide

**Transition Guidelines:**
- Use one transition style throughout presentation
- Keep transitions subtle and quick (0.5-1 second)
- Avoid distracting transitions like spinning or checkerboard
- Consider your audience and context

### Slide Layout Templates

**Title Slide Elements:**
- Presentation title (largest text)
- Subtitle or description
- Presenter name and credentials
- Date and venue
- Company/organization logo

**Content Slide Layouts:**
- **Single Point:** One main idea with supporting visual
- **Comparison:** Two or three items side by side
- **Process:** Sequential steps with arrows or numbers
- **Quote:** Large quotation with attribution
- **Image Focus:** Large image with minimal text overlay

**Section Break Slides:**
- Large section title
- Relevant background image or color
- Minimal additional text
- Consistent with overall design theme

### Presentation Types and Adaptations

**Educational Presentations:**
